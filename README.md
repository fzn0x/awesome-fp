## Events

> List of Functional Programming events.

- [Fun(c) 2018.4: Adam Rosien - why do Functional Programmers always talk about Algebra(s)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2ay9nEW3ak) - Why functional programmers talk about them constantly, and how you can use them in your projects.

## Tools

> List of Functional Programming supported tools.

- [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/) - Reason lets you write simple, fast and quality type safe code while leveraging both the JavaScript & OCaml ecosystems.
  - [BuckleScript & Reason - ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) - ReScript is a robustly typed language that compiles to efficient and human-readable JavaScript. It comes with a lightning fast compiler toolchain that scales to any codebase size.
- [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) - OCaml is an industrial-strength programming language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles
- [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) - A delightful language
for reliable web applications.
- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) - Clojure is a dialect of Lisp, and shares with Lisp the code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system. Clojure is predominantly a functional programming language, and features a rich set of immutable, persistent data structures.
  - [ClojureScript](https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript) - Clojure to JS compiler. LISP-like language, as is ClojureScript, and has extensive library support.
- [PureScript](https://www.purescript.org/) - A strongly-typed functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles language.
- [F Sharp/F#](https://fsharp.org/) - F# empowers everyone to write succinct, robust and performant code
  - [Fable](https://fable.io/) - Fable is a compiler that brings F# into the JavaScript ecosystem
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) - Elixir is a dynamic, functional language for building scalable and maintainable applications.
- [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) - An advanced, purely functional programming language
- [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) - Practical functional programming
for a parallel world
- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) - Scala combines object-oriented and functional programming in one concise, high-level language.
